# CLAUDE.md — Awakened (Habit RPG)

Onboarding doc for any future Claude session working on this project. Reflects the actual state of the code (not what it might become). All values are extracted from the source.

## Project at a glance

**Awakened — Daily Habit Tracker** (`com.goallearner.awakened`, name on App Store: *Awakened: Habit RPG*).

A vanilla-JS PWA wrapped into a native iOS app via Capacitor + Codemagic. The app is a Solo-Leveling-flavored habit tracker: each completion grants XP, ranks the user from E → S+, and develops 6 stats that determine a "class." There is no backend — every byte of state lives in `localStorage`.

- **Current marketing version:** `1.1.0` (constant `APP_VERSION` in `app.js`)
- **Service-worker cache version:** `v4.42` (constant `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js`)
- **GitHub:** `github.com/GoalLearner/awakened-app` (private)
- **iOS App ID:** `6764727990`

## Tech stack & file map

Pure HTML / CSS / JS. No build step for the web app. The only "build" is Capacitor wrapping the static files into an iOS bundle.

| File | Lines | Purpose |
|------|-------|---------|
| `index.html` | 768 | All markup. Tabs, panels, sheets, modals, banners. |
| `app.js` | 5866 | All logic. Single file IIFE — every runtime constant, every render function, every event wiring. |
| `styles.css` | 7795 | All styling. Defines a `:root` token set + a `body.theme-light` override. |
| `sw.js` | 178 | Service worker. Precaches app shell + 8 avatar PNGs. Generates `icon-192/512.png` on the fly via OffscreenCanvas. |
| `manifest.json` | 24 | PWA manifest. Theme `#0a0a0a`. Standalone portrait. |
| `capacitor.config.json` | — | Capacitor config. `webDir: www`. |
| `codemagic.yaml` | — | iOS build pipeline. Copies static files → `www/`, runs `npx cap sync ios`, sets `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`, builds & uploads to TestFlight. |
| `serve.ps1` | 52 | Local dev server, defaults to port 8080. Cache-Control: no-store. Set `$env:PORT=NNNN` to override. |
| `avatar-*.png` | — | 8 silhouette PNGs (base + 7 classes). RGBA with proper alpha. |
| `resources/ios/AppIcon.appiconset/` | — | Custom iOS app icon, copied into the iOS build by Codemagic. |

## Color system (the actual values)

### CSS custom properties (dark, default)

```css
--bg:               #13132a   /* app background */
--bg-raised:        #16163a   /* sheets, modals */
--bg-card:          #1e1e3f   /* habit cards */
--bg-card-active:   #22224a
--bg-header:        #0f0f24
--border:           rgba(255,255,255,0.10)
--border-accent:    rgba(139,92,246,0.50)
--text-primary:     #f2f2f7
--text-secondary:   #8e8e93
--text-tertiary:    #48484a
--accent:           #8b5cf6   /* purple — primary brand */
--accent-glow:      rgba(139,92,246,0.18)
--gold:             #f59e0b   /* gold — Compound Effect Bonus, S+ rank, weekend 2x */
--gold-glow:        rgba(245,158,11,0.25)
--safe-top / --safe-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-*)
```

`body.theme-light` overrides these (warm parchment palette, `#e8d5b0` background) but accent purple/gold stay the same.

### Difficulty colors (used in UI badges)

| Difficulty | Color |
|------------|-------|
| Easy       | `#a78bfa` (purple-400) |
| Medium     | `#60a5fa` (blue-400) |
| Hard       | `#fb923c` (orange-400) |
| Legendary  | `#fbbf24` (amber-400) |

### Stat colors (used in History grid, radar chart, badges)

| Stat | Color | Hex |
|------|-------|-----|
| STR (Strength)     | red    | `#ef4444` |
| VIT (Vitality)     | pink   | `#ec4899` |
| INT (Intelligence) | blue   | `#3b82f6` |
| FOCUS              | yellow | `#eab308` |
| WILL (Willpower)   | orange | `#f97316` |
| WLT (Wealth)       | gold   | `#f59e0b` |

### Rank colors (`RANK_EFFECTS` in `app.js`)

| Rank | Color | Effect on rank-up |
|------|-------|------|
| D    | `#8b5cf6` (purple) | basic |
| C    | `#8b5cf6` (purple) | 12 particles |
| B    | `#3b82f6` (blue)   | shockwave |
| A    | `#a855f7` (purple) | lightning |
| S    | `#f97316` (orange) | shake + 30 particles + shockwave |
| S+   | `#f59e0b` (gold)   | shake + rain |

## XP / Rank / Stat math (single sources of truth)

### Difficulty XP (`DIFFICULTY` constant)

| Diff | Base pts | Weekend pts (2×) |
|------|----------|------------------|
| easy      | 1  | 2  |
| medium    | 3  | 6  |
| hard      | 5  | 10 |
| legendary | 10 | 20 |

`diffPts(diff)` returns base × 2 on Sat/Sun PT.

### Rank thresholds (`RANKS` constant)

| Rank | Min pts | Max pts | Description |
|------|---------|---------|-------------|
| E  | 0      | 499      | Just getting started |
| D  | 500    | 1,499    | Building awareness |
| C  | 1,500  | 3,499    | Consistency is forming |
| B  | 3,500  | 6,999    | Above average. Most people never get here. |
| A  | 7,000  | 13,999   | True excellence. This is rare. |
| S  | 14,000 | 27,999   | Elite. You have become the habit. |
| S+ | 28,000 | ∞        | Legendary. Less than 1% operate at this level. |

### Per-stat leveling (1 → 20 cap)

XP cost FROM level `l` TO `l+1` (`xpToNextLevel`):

```
l=1→2:   5    l=8→9:  180   l=15→16: 600
l=2→3:  15    l=9→10: 225   l=16→17: 680
l=3→4:  30    l=10→11:275   l=17→18: 765
l=4→5:  50    l=11→12:330   l=18→19: 855
l=5→6:  75    l=12→13:390   l=19→20: 950
l=6→7: 105    l=13→14:455
l=7→8: 140    l=14→15:525
```

Total to cap: **6,650 XP** per stat (`MAX_STAT_XP`).

### Stat bonus thresholds (`STAT_BONUS_THRESHOLDS`)

Awarded once per stat when level is reached:

| Level | Bonus pts |
|-------|-----------|
| 5     | 25  |
| 10    | 75  |
| 15    | 150 |
| 20    | 500 |

Plus `fully_awakened` achievement (Total Level 120 across all 6 stats) = **+2,000 bonus XP**.

### Class detection (`determineClass`)

Computed from current per-stat levels:

- If top stat ≤ level 1 → `SAGE` (brand new player)
- If 2nd stat = 0 OR (top / 2nd) ≥ 1.4 → top stat's class
- Otherwise → `SAGE` (balanced)

Class shifting flag (`isClassShifting`) appears at ratio ≥ 1.2 but < 1.4 (transition zone).

| Stat | Class | Color | Avatar file |
|------|-------|-------|-------------|
| STR    | Warrior  | `#ef4444` | `avatar-warrior.png` |
| VIT    | Ranger   | `#ec4899` | `avatar-ranger.png` |
| INT    | Mage     | `#3b82f6` | `avatar-mage.png` |
| FOCUS  | Assassin | `#eab308` | `avatar-assassin.png` |
| WILL   | Paladin  | `#f97316` | `avatar-paladin.png` |
| WLT    | Merchant | `#f59e0b` | `avatar-merchant.png` |
| (none) | Sage     | `#8b5cf6` | `avatar-sage.png`    |
| 0 XP   | —        | —         | `avatar-base.png`    |

## Compound Effect Bonus

Triggered when a user has **ALL 10 canonical Morning Routine habits** in their active list AND completes every one scheduled today. Eligibility is composition-based, not pack-membership-based — custom-path users qualify too.

**Canonical 10 (PACKS[0].habits, 0-indexed into DEFAULT_HABITS):**

```
2  Sleep before midnight
23 Wake up at consistent time
14 No phone or social media after waking
16 Get morning sunlight
41 Morning gratitude practice
6  Daily walk
46 Vitamins and minerals
12 Meditate & Breathwork
4  Strength training
19 Whole foods diet
```

Bonus XP by streak (`getCompoundXP`):

| Streak day | XP |
|------------|----|
| 1–7        | 5  |
| 8–30       | 10 |
| 31–90      | 20 |
| 91–180     | 30 |
| 181–365    | 50 |
| 366+       | 75 |

XP doubles on weekends. Modal fires the `playFanfare()` audio (D-major arpeggio + sustained chord). Regular `playCheckSound()` is suppressed on the 10th completion to avoid stacking sounds.

Single source-of-truth helpers (in `app.js`):
- `getMorningPack()`, `getMorningHabitDefs()`
- `isMorningHabit(habit)`
- `getMissingMorningHabits()`
- `userHasAllCanonicalMorning()`

**Always reuse these — never hardcode the 10-habit list elsewhere.**

---

## The 49-habit master library

`DEFAULT_HABITS` in `app.js` (lines ~523–. Indices 0–48).

Categories (`OB_CATEGORIES`):

| Category | Indices |
|----------|---------|
| 💪 Physical Performance       | 0–10  |
| 🧠 Mental & Focus             | 11–18 |
| 🥗 Nutrition                  | 19–22 |
| ⚡ Discipline & Productivity  | 23–30 |
| 💰 Financial & Growth         | 31–34 |
| 🎯 Learning & Skills          | 35–40 |
| 🌱 Wellbeing & Relationships  | 41–48 |

Every habit definition has, after `app.js` initialization:

```js
{
  emoji:        '...',
  name:         '...',     // EXACT string used as foreign key everywhere
  difficulty:   'easy' | 'medium' | 'hard' | 'legendary',
  type:         'build' (default) | 'quit',
  primaryStat:  'STR' | 'VIT' | 'INT' | 'FOCUS' | 'WILL' | 'WLT',
}
```

Mapping tables (separate constants applied to defs at startup):
- `HABIT_PRIMARY_STAT` — habit name → stat
- `HABIT_DESCRIPTIONS` — habit name → curated 1-paragraph description
- `MEASURABLE_HABITS` — habit name → `{ unit, def, step, min }` for habits with quantitative goals

**Rule: a habit's identity is its `name` string.** `id` is generated per-user (`uid()`). When checking equivalence anywhere, match by name.

---

## Tabs & screens

Bottom nav (icon-only, purple glow on active):

| Tab | Icon | Panel id |
|-----|------|----------|
| Profile  | 🗡️ | `profile-panel` |
| Habits   | ✅ | `main-scroll` |
| Stats    | 📊 | `stats-panel` |
| History  | 📅 | `history-panel` |
| Quests   | ⚔️ | `quests-panel` *(coming-soon placeholder)* |
| Items    | 🎴 | `items-panel`  *(coming-soon placeholder)* |
| Social   | 👥 | `social-panel` *(coming-soon placeholder)* |

Bottom sheets (all use `attachSheetDismissGesture()` for swipe-down dismiss):

- `#settings-sheet` — settings + theme + sound + What's New + reset
- `#lib-sheet` — Add Habits browser
- `#hd-sheet` — habit detail / config (slides over lib-sheet)
- `#sched-sheet` — schedule picker
- `#stat-detail-sheet` — Stats tab → tap a stat
- `#hi-sheet` — History tab → ⓘ icon (read-only quick view)
- `#note-modal` — long-press → View Note (full habit detail page; **note text is read-only, sourced from `getHabitDescription`**)
- `#whats-new-sheet` — auto-shows on first launch after version bump
- `#mr-overlay` — Add Morning Routine confirmation (center modal, NOT a bottom sheet)

Center / celebration modals (do NOT add swipe dismiss):
- Compound Effect Bonus, Rank Up, Stat Level Up, Class Change, Perfect Day, Achievement Unlock, Friday Challenge

---

## Reusable utilities (use these, don't reinvent)

| Function | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `attachSheetDismissGesture(sheet, overlay, onDismiss, opts)` | Swipe-down + flick to dismiss. Handles touchstart/move/end + mouse for desktop. Honours `scrollTarget` so internal scrolling doesn't hijack the gesture. |
| `populateHabitInfoBlock(prefix, habit)` | Renders the shared stat-badge + description + 4-cell stats grid. Used by both History info popup (`prefix='hi'`) and View Note (`prefix='vn'`). |
| `getHabitDescription(habit)` | Looks up canonical description by name from `DEFAULT_HABITS`. |
| `getHabitPrimaryStat(habit)` | Stat lookup with backward-compat fallback through `DEFAULT_HABITS`. |
| `getHabitStatColor(habit)` | Convenience wrapper for the above. |
| `playCheckSound()`, `playFanfare()` | Web Audio. Both gated on `soundEnabled`. |
| `esc(str)`, `colorWithAlpha(hex, alpha)` | HTML-escape + color helpers used in inline `style="..."` building. |

## localStorage keys (every persisted bit)

Prefix `hb_` for almost everything:

| Key | Type | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|
| `hb_habits`            | JSON array of habit objects | Source of truth for user's active habits |
| `hb_completions`       | `{ 'YYYY-MM-DD': [habitId, ...] }` | Per-day completion log |
| `hb_streaks`           | `{ habitId: { count, lastDate, prevCount, prevLastDate } }` | |
| `hb_points`            | int (string) | Total XP |
| `hb_achievements`      | JSON array of achievement IDs | |
| `hb_stats`             | `{ statId: { pts: N } }` | |
| `hb_stat_bonuses`      | array of `"STAT-LEVEL"` strings | Prevents re-awarding tier bonuses |
| `hb_perfect_streak`    | `{ count, lastDate, prevCount, prevLastDate }` | |
| `hb_ps_awarded`        | array of milestone day numbers | |
| `hb_notes`             | `{ habitId: 'text' }` | Legacy — orphaned but preserved. **Do not display, do not delete.** |
| `hb_compound`          | `{ packId: { streak, lastDate } }` | |
| `hb_compound_awarded`  | `{ packId: 'YYYY-MM-DD' }` | Prevents double-award per day |
| `hb_path`              | `'morning' \| 'custom' \| null` | |
| `hb_name`              | string | Player name, default 'Hunter' |
| `hb_class`             | string | Stored class id |
| `hb_welcomed`          | `'1'` | Welcome screen seen flag |
| `hb_theme`             | `'dark' \| 'light'` | |
| `hb_sound`             | `'on' \| 'off'` | Sound toggle |
| `hb_whats_new_seen`    | version string (e.g., `'1.1.0'`) | |
| `hb_friday_banner_<date>` | `'1'` | Per-Friday banner-seen flag |

All dates stored in **America/Los_Angeles** timezone via `getPTDate()`. Timezone is a hard rule.

## Build & deploy pipeline

### Web (Netlify)

`git push` → Netlify auto-builds and deploys the static files. After every push, **bump `CACHE_VERSION` in `sw.js`** so the new SW activates and existing PWA users get fresh files.

### iOS (Codemagic → TestFlight → App Store)

1. `git push` to `main`
2. Codemagic → **Start new build** → workflow `Awakened — iOS App Store`
3. Codemagic does:
   - `npm install`
   - `cp index.html styles.css app.js sw.js manifest.json www/` + `cp avatar-*.png www/`
   - `npx cap add ios` (if missing) + `npx cap sync ios`
   - Installs custom AppIcon
   - Runs PlistBuddy: `Add :ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption bool false` (skips Apple's compliance question)
   - `xcode-project use-profiles` + `build-ipa`
   - Uploads to App Store Connect → TestFlight beta review
4. Update on iPhone via TestFlight → manual submit on App Store Connect

The `ios/`, `android/`, `www/`, and `node_modules/` directories are gitignored — Codemagic regenerates them every build.

### Cache-busting & version bumps (always do all three together)

Every meaningful change must:

1. Edit `index.html`: bump `?v=N` on the `<link>` for `styles.css` and `<script>` for `app.js`
2. Edit `sw.js`: bump `CACHE_VERSION = 'v4.NN'`
3. (For iOS releases only) Edit `app.js`: bump `APP_VERSION` and add a `WHATS_NEW` entry for the new version

The current state is `styles.css?v=99`, `app.js?v=100`, `sw.js v4.42`, `APP_VERSION = '1.1.0'`. (Re-check from the files; they drift quickly.)

---

## Conventions & non-obvious rules

**Date / time.** All "today" comparisons use `getPTDate()` (PT-locale ISO date). Never `new Date().toISOString()` — that's UTC and breaks streaks for west-coast users.

**Single source of truth.** When a piece of data could plausibly live in two places, it doesn't. The 10-habit Morning Routine, primary stats, descriptions, color values — every map has exactly one home and helpers around it. Adding a new habit means editing `DEFAULT_HABITS`, `HABIT_PRIMARY_STAT`, `HABIT_DESCRIPTIONS`, and (if measurable) `MEASURABLE_HABITS`. Nothing else.

**Habit identity = name.** `id` is per-user (`uid()`); `name` is the foreign key used for matching against the master library. Never compare habits by id across the user → library boundary.

**Read-only by design.**
- The "About this habit" section on View Note pulls from `HABIT_DESCRIPTIONS` and is **not editable**. Old `habitNotes` localStorage is preserved but dead.
- Difficulty in Edit Habit is **not editable** (`.diff-row--locked` class + no click listener). Only name and emoji are editable.

**Bottom sheet vs center modal.** Bottom sheets get swipe-down dismiss. Celebration modals (Compound Effect, Rank Up, Perfect Day, Class Change, Achievement Unlock) explicitly do **not** — they're earned moments, not flow interruptions.

**Sound.** All audio is Web Audio API only. No external files. Two functions: `playCheckSound()` (~280ms chime per habit complete) and `playFanfare()` (~1.4s D-major flourish for compound bonus). Both gated on `soundEnabled` (toggle in Settings, persisted to `hb_sound`).

**Reduced motion.** Quote rotation respects `prefers-reduced-motion` indirectly — actually, the current code does NOT gate on it (an earlier guard was removed because it caused issues). If you re-add motion guards, do so consciously.

**Layout shift.** History rows use CSS Grid (`grid-template-columns: 144px repeat(7, minmax(36px, 1fr)) 62px`) — header and habit rows share the exact track. **Do not switch to flex.** A previous bug had the day letters drift half a column.

**Anchor pattern.** Every modal/sheet has a `closeXxx()` function that mirrors the open path. Never close by class-toggle alone — go through the close function so any cleanup runs.

**No emojis on the History tab.** Habit rows on History are emoji-free, bold, full names with NO duration suffix (`habitBaseName(habit)` strips `• 30 min`, etc.). All other tabs keep emojis and full names.

**Banner priority.** When multiple banners could show on the Habits tab, only one shows. Order: streak-danger > double-XP-weekend > morning-routine-nudge.

---

## Common pitfalls

- **Editing `app.js` and forgetting `?v=N`.** Browser will serve the cached old script; you'll think your change is broken when it just hasn't loaded.
- **Adding a new sheet without `attachSheetDismissGesture`.** Users will report "I can't dismiss it." Always wire it up unless it's intentionally a celebration modal.
- **Hardcoding the canonical 10 habits.** Use `getMorningHabitDefs()`. Always.
- **Shipping iOS without bumping `APP_VERSION` + `WHATS_NEW`.** TestFlight will reject "same build number" or you'll silently re-show the wrong What's New.
- **Mutating `DEFAULT_HABITS` after startup.** It's enriched once at load with `primaryStat`. Don't mutate later or you'll create inconsistent state across reloads.
- **Renaming a habit.** Habit name is the foreign key for stats, packs, descriptions, completion lookups. Renaming a habit silently breaks streak inheritance for any existing user. If you must rename, write a migration in `load()`.
- **Letting `node_modules/`, `ios/`, `www/`, or the avatar `originals-rgb` folder slip into git.** They're gitignored — verify before pushing.
- **Forgetting `ITSAppUsesNonExemptEncryption=false`.** Already wired into `codemagic.yaml`. Don't remove it or every TestFlight upload will require manual compliance acknowledgement.

## Quick references

- **Local dev:** `cd habit-tracker && $env:PORT=8081; .\serve.ps1` → `http://localhost:8081`
- **Hard refresh:** `Ctrl + Shift + R` after CSS/JS changes
- **DevTools service worker:** Application tab → Service Workers → Unregister, then refresh, if updates feel stuck
- **Install Capacitor deps:** `& "C:\Program Files\nodejs\npm.cmd" install` (PATH may need full path on Windows)
- **Git status:** Repo is `github.com/GoalLearner/awakened-app`, branch `main`. Net new uncommitted files often get reported by the system reminder; check `git status` before commits.
